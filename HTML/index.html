            Hereâ€™s a taste of my day-to-day:

            Developed a user-friendly interface that even my grandma could use, and she's still puzzled by toasters.
            Squashed more bugs than an overzealous exterminator on a mission.
            Made the app so smooth, users said it was like butter on a hot pancake.        <li>

            <li>Implemented real-time tracking because no one likes waiting in the rain, especially when you're dreaming of your crush.</li>
